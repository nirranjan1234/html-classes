        <h2>this school's mascot is an Alligator</h2>
        <h3>but it is shortened to "Gator"</h3>
        <b>But Do Not Call It A Crocodile!</b>
        <br>
        <strong>Because it is not!</strong>
        <br>
        <i>Why?</i>
        <em>Because Crocodile and Alligator are two different things!</em>
        <br>
        <mark>They may look similar, But are very different!</mark>
